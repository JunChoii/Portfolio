          I am passionate about programming and web development, I thrive on
          collaborating with others to create innovative solutions.<br /><br />
          With expertise in a range of technologies including JS, React, Next,
          PHP, MySQL, Sqlite, Node.js, and Neon, I bring a blend of front-end
          and back-end skills to the table. I enjoy the creative process of
          building user-friendly web applications that deliver tangible
          results.<br /><br />
          My current interests lie in exploring the potential of machine
          learning within web/mobile app development projects. I envision
          leveraging my skills to develop advanced task management systems,
          serving as intuitive assistants for users across various aspects of
          their lives â€“ be it work, academia, or beyond.<br /><br />
          Eager to embark on new challenges and contribute my expertise to
          dynamic projects, I am open to exciting opportunities in the field of
          programming and beyond.
